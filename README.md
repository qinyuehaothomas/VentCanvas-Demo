# What is this code base?
https://huggingface.co/Dpngtm/wav2vec2-emotion-recognition
A large chunck of the code is copy-pasted from the sample given\
(cuz i have no idea how to use HuggingFace / Transformers)

I'm trying to code <s>Vibe Code</s> the VentCanva feature\
I don't know how to make andriod apps, so i can only make a flask webapp for now...

# How it works
A simple site deployed on Vercel,
- When recording, send audio live back to server
- Server runs Transformer and recognise emotion
- server returns a set of "emotions"
- Front End JS draw the artwork
